# demo
for Demo purposes 

## Procedure
1. I created a repo from github.
2. Copied the link and created a new folder and then cloned my online repo using command `git clone <link to the online repo> . `. With the dot at the end it clones the repository to the current folder.
3. Went ahead and opened the folder in VScode which is my code editor and this is where i am currently.
4. For me to push code I need to make some changes and this changes include what I am typing in this file. So assuming you have made changes or wrote code now you want to commit to your online repo.
5. I will open my vscode Terminal and type the command `git status`.This command will show me the changes i have made in the various files.
`pwd` - prints the current directory/folder we are in.
6. Now I need to stage these changes i have made so I will type the command `git add .` or `git add *`.
